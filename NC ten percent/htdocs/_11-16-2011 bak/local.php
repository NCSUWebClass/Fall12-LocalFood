			Farmers, restaurants, businesses and institutions are increasingly responding to consumer demand for local foods. Statewide, consumers support more than 200 farmers’ markets. The number of farm-direct to-consumer partnerships—known formally as <a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/chatham/ag/SustAg/csaguide.html">Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)</a> programs—are also on the rise, as are local buying clubs, home delivery businesses, <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/food-coops/">food co-ops</a> and grocery stores offering local foods, promoting local farmers and engaging in the community.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina Cooperative Extension</a> is supporting the <span style="font-weight:bold;">10% Campaign</span> by designating a local foods coordinator in all 100 counties. These in-the-field experts are a great resource and can help you find local foods, farmers and community events.
		</p>
		<p>
			Help us grow! Let your community/businesses leaders know that buying local foods is important to you, your friends, family and colleagues. Tell them <a href="about.php">about the 10% Campaign</a> and encourage them to sign on today.
