	<h2>WELCOME, [BNAME]!</h2>
	
	<p>Being a part of the 10% Campaign strengthens our statewide effort in growing our local food economy!</p>

	<h3>Why 10 percent?</h3>

	<p>North Carolinians spend about $35 billion a year on food. If individuals spend just 10% on local foods, ($1.05 per day) that $3.5 billion would be available in the local economy. A restaurant business can directly impact local farmers, and communities with its purchasing dollars!</p>
