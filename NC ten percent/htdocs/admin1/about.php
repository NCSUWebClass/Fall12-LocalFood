            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            
            <p>We’re challenging you to spend 10 percent of your existing food dollars to support North Carolina food producers, businesses and communities. Join the <strong>10% Campaign</strong> today!</p>
            
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Why 10 Percent?</h2>
            
            <p>It is achievable for most and meaningful for all:</p>
            
            <ul style="position:relative; top:-10px; list-style-type: disc; line-height:1.9em;">
                <li>We spend about <strong>$35 billion a year on food.</strong> If we spent 10 percent - <strong>$1.05 per day</strong>  locally - approximately $3.5 billion would be available in the local economy.</li>
                <li>A vibrant <strong>local food economy</strong> will support farms, food and manufacturing businesses and create jobs.</li>
                <li>Infusing fresh and flavorful fruits and vegetables into diets can significantly reduce diet-related diseases and long-term health care expenses for everyone.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Here's How it Works</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Join the campaign!</strong> Register and pledge to spend 10 percent of your food budget on foods produced/grown locally.</p>

            <ul style="position:relative; top:-10px; list-style-type: disc;">

            <h2>The 10% Core Team</h2>
            
            <p>The <a href="http://www.cefs.ncsu.edu/">Center for Environmental Farming Systems</a> (CEFS) is leading the <strong>10% Campaign.</strong> Through its 2009 Farm to Fork initiative and resulting <a href="http://www.cefs.ncsu.edu/resources/stateactionguide2010.pdf">action guide</a>, CEFS has energized and connected thousands of North Carolinians determined to build our local food economy. Grant funding for the <strong>10% Campaign</strong> is provided by the <a href="http://www.goldenleaf.org/">Golden LEAF Foundation</a>. CEFS is working with North Carolina Cooperative Extension and Charlotte-based Compass Group, the world's largest foodservice company, to develop the early and long-term components of the campaign.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu">North Carolina Cooperative Extension</a> agents are supporting the <strong>10% Campaign</strong> by acting as local foods coordinators in all 100 counties. Working with other community leaders, farmers, businesses, local governments, parents, teachers and students, and others, these on-the-ground experts are:</p>
            
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li><strong>Encouraging</strong> farmers and businesses to increase their capacities; and helping to <strong>grow new farmers;</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Promoting</strong> local foods, food producers and related businesses within their communities;</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting</strong> “backyard farmers” and community gardens;</li>
                <li><strong>Connecting</strong> farms to schools, businesses, faith-based organizations, health organizations and many more.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><a href="http://www.cgnad.com/">Compass Group</a> will lead the way for institutional consumers by working with CEFS to develop a model “farm-to-institution” buying program and by sourcing 10 percent of the produce it serves in its North Carolina foodservice accounts from local farmers.</p>
