Q: I have a business/organization/farm/etc. – How can we support the campaign?
</p>
<p>
We partner with all sizes and types of businesses and organizations throughout the state. There are many ways to support the Campaign.
We encourage all North Carolinians to join us in support of a healthy, localized food system in our state.

A business who reports its local food purchases, contributing to the campaign’s website display for the dollars spent on local foods.
</p><br />

</p><br />

Q: How do I start a 10% Campaign in my state? 
</p>
<p>
The NC 10% Campaign came out of a Farm to Fork Initiative of the Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) located in NC. 
</p><br />
<p>
You can review the state action guide resulting from this initiative and the local food summit at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/project/nc10percent/learnmore.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/project/nc10percent/learnmore.php</a>.<br /><br />
We would like to encourage a campaign in other states. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:nc10percent@ncsu.edu">nc10percent@ncsu.edu</a>.

Q: I have signed up for the NC 10% Campaign but have not heard back. What should I do? 
</p>
<p>
If you signed up as an individual, you should have received an activation email from nc10percent@ncsu.edu. Look in your junk/spam mail as your email provider may have accidently screened the email message. You must activate your membership in order to participate in the campaign. Once you activate your account, you will receive a weekly asking how much you spent on local foods, where you purchased your foods, and how much you saved by harvesting your own.
<br /><br />
If you signed up as a business/organization, you should have been contacted by your county’s Local Food Coordinator or by the NC 10% Campaign. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:nc10percent@ncsu.edu">nc10percent@ncsu.edu</a> if you have not heard back from us and please include the name of your business in the email subject line.
