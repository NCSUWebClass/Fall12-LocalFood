		<p>In 2007, the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Center for Environmental Farming Systems</span> (CEFS) and its many partners sought to ask — and answer — the question:</p>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">Can we build a sustainable local food economy, from farm to fork?</p>

		<p>Through the CEFS <span style="font-weight:bold;">Farm to Fork</span> initiative and with the active and enthusiastic support of thousands of North Carolinians and hundreds of local, regional and statewide organizations, the clear answer is: <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">YES!</span></p> 

		<p>For a big-picture perspective, review CEFS’ From <a href="http://www.cefs.ncsu.edu/newsevents/news/2010/0421stateactionguide.html">Farm to Fork: Building North Carolina’s Local Sustainable Food Economy</a>. This statewide action guide identifies goals and the strategies needed to move North Carolina forward.</p>

		<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">10% Campaign</span> is one way <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">you</span> can support this statewide initiative!</p>
