Q: I have a business/organization/farm/etc. – How can we support the campaign?
</a>
</p>
<div id="faq2" style="display:none">
<p>
We partner with all sizes and types of businesses and organizations throughout the state. There are many ways to support the Campaign.
We encourage all North Carolinians to join us in support of a healthy, localized food system in our state.
</p><br />
<p>
Here are three ways a business entity can partner with the campaign:
</p><br />
<p><strong>Pledge of Purchase Partner</strong></p>
<p>
A business who reports its local food purchases, contributing to the campaign’s website display for the dollars spent on local foods.
</p><br />
<p>
Example: Hosting a Meeting, conference or annual retreat where NC foods are purchased or catered. Those $$ you spend can be part of your contribution to our local economy – let us know and we’ll proudly display it to the world.
</p><br />
<p><strong>Employee or members program Partner</strong></p>
<p>
An organization can promote the campaign internally, encouraging support by its employees or members.
</p><br />
<p>
Example: Host an event that brings employees and the campaign together around a cause. Create awareness through your newsletters or internal marketing.
</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Promotion and Outreach Partner</strong></p>
<p>
Any business interested in sustainable agriculture, North Carolina’s local food economy, and strengthening our food system or growing the campaign’s awareness activities through outbound promotion to customers and clients.
</p><br />
<p>
Example: A farm displays our signs; A Girl Scout Troop hosts a community garden event; A local sandwich shop offers a campaign t-shirt for sale.

Q: How do I start a 10% Campaign in my state? 
</a>
</p>
<div id="faq4" style="display:none">
<p>
The NC 10% Campaign came out of a Farm to Fork Initiative of the Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) located in NC. 
</p><br />
<p>
You can review the state action guide resulting from this initiative and the local food summit at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/project/nc10percent/learnmore.php">http://www.ncsu.edu/project/nc10percent/learnmore.php</a>.<br /><br />
We would like to encourage a campaign in other states. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:nc10percent@ncsu.edu">nc10percent@ncsu.edu</a>.

Q: I have signed up for the NC 10% Campaign but have not heard back. What should I do? 
</a>
</p>
<div id="faq5" style="display:none">
<p>
If you signed up as an individual, you should have received an activation email from nc10percent@ncsu.edu. Look in your junk/spam mail as your email provider may have accidently screened the email message. You must activate your membership in order to participate in the campaign. Once you activate your account, you will receive a weekly email asking how much you spent on local foods, where you purchased your foods, and how much you saved by harvesting your own.
<br /><br />
If you signed up as a business/organization, you should have been contacted by your county’s Local Food Coordinator or by the NC 10% Campaign. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:nc10percent@ncsu.edu">nc10percent@ncsu.edu</a> if you have not heard back from us and please include the name of your business in the email subject line.

We think harvesting your own food is great! In your weekly email report we added an option for you to include an estimate of how much money you saved by growing your vegetables, collecting eggs, hunting or fishing. Collecting this baseline data is very important to us.
